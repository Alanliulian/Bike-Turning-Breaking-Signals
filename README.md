# Bike-Turning-Breaking-Signals
A DIY project to create a bike signal system with turn signals and brake lights. The system uses an Arduino to control LED lights based on inputs from handlebar-mounted switches and brake sensors.

## Features

- Brake light activation using brake sensors
- Left and right turn signals
- High-intensity LEDs for visibility
- Rechargeable battery pack

## Components

- Push-button switches
- High-intensity LEDs
- Arduino Uno
- Transistors/Relays
- Rechargeable battery pack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Basic soldering and wiring tools
